In the PETREMAC program, we will take a novel approach by implementing new endocrine regimens proven effective in metastatic breast cancer, into early treatment of Luminal A-like tumors. If successful, this may substantially enhance the benefit of endocrine therapy, to facilitate higher pCR rates and hopefully improved survival. Moreover, we amend the chemotherapy program for the other tumor subtypes, applying new types of targeted therapy aiming at improving pCR, but at the same time limiting toxicity. Importantly, systematic exploration of molecular parameters will allow for improved identification of patients for whom different treatment options may be optimal. Each tumor will be analysed for additional potential predictive factors; for tumors treated with endocrine therapy our main goal is to identify parameters predicting benefit from endocrine therapy, for tumors undergoing chemotherapy we focus on DNA repair defects, but also potential defects in the p53 pathway and other cell cycle regulators. By doing so, we aim at identifying predictive factors allowing individual therapy selection for patients. In the long term perspective, this may also enable development of novel therapeutic strategies.
