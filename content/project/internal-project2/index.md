title: Neuroendocrine Carcinomas Project
---

The present project is based on the worldâ€™s largest biobank of GEP-patients. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples and matched blood samples have been collected throughout Scandinavia in the period 2013 to 2017 and are collected from patients diagnosed with High Grade GEP NEN, included prospectively in a Nordic GEP Registry. At present, 250 cases with both tumour and blood samples are included and another 50-100 cases are pending. Inclusion criteria were: histopathological confirmed diagnosis of neuroendocrine neoplasm (Ki-67>20%) with a gastroenteropancreatic primary or an unknown primary (CUP) predominantly with GI metastases. Clinical information, tumour tissue and a whole blood sample for normal tissue analyses were collected. Histological sections (HE, CgA, synaptophycin, Ki-67) were collected and have been subject to centralized pathological re-evaluation for validation of NEN G3 diagnosis, cell-type and recount of Ki-67. Treatments given, response to treatment (RECIST), progression free survival and overall survival data were collected for all patients.
