abstract: High-grade (HG) gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) are
  rare but have a very poor prognosis and represent a severely understudied class of tumours.
  Molecular data for HG GEP-NEN are limited, and treatment strategies for the carcinoma are extrapolated from small-cell lung cancer (SCLC).
  After pathological re-evaluation we analysed
  DNA tumours and matched blood samples from 181 HG GEP-NEN patients; 152 neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC) and 29 neuroendocrine tumors (NET G3).
  Based on the sequencing of 360 cancer-related genes,we assessed mutations and copy number alterations (CNA).
  For NEC, frequently mutated genes were TP53 (64%), APC (28%), KRAS (22%) and BRAF (20%).
  RB1 was only mutated in 14%, but CNAs affecting RB1 were seen in 34%. Other frequent copy number losses were
  ARID1A (35%), ESR1 (25%) and ATM (31%). Frequent amplifications/gains were found in MYC (51%) and KDM5A (45%).
  While these molecular features had limited similarities with SCLC, we found potentially targetable alterations in 66% of the NEC samples.
  Mutations and CNA varied according to primary tumour site with BRAF mutations mainly seen in colon (49%), and FBXW7 mutations mainly seen in rectal cancers (25%).
  Eight out of 152 (5.3%) NEC were microsatellite instable (MSI). NET G3 had frequent mutations in MEN1 (21%), ATRX (17%), DAXX, SETD2 and TP53 (each 14%). We show molecular differences in HG GEP-NEN, related to morphological differentiation and site of origin. Limited similarities to SCLC and a high fraction of targetable alterations indicate a high potential for betterpersonalized treatments.
