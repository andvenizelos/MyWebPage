abstract: Subclonal evolution during primary breast cancer treatment is largely unexplored. 
  We aimed to assess the dynamic changes in
  subclonal composition of treatment-naïve breast cancers during neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 
  We performed whole exome sequencing of tumor biopsies collected before, at therapy switch, 
  and after treatment with sequential epirubicin and docetaxel monotherapy in 51 out of 109 patients with
  primary breast cancer, who were included in a prospectively registered, neoadjuvant single-arm phase II trial.
  There was a profound and
  differential redistribution of subclones during epirubicin and docetaxel treatment, regardless of therapy response. 
  While truncal mutations and main subclones persisted, smaller subclones frequently appeared or disappeared. Reassessment of raw data, beyond
  formal mutation calling,
  indicated that the majority of subclones seemingly appearing during treatment were in fact present in pretreatment breast cancers, 
  below conventional detection limits. Likewise, subclones which seemingly disappeared were still present, below detection limits, in most
  cases where tumor tissue remained. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) dropped during neoadjuvant therapy, and copy number analysis demonstrated
  specific
  genomic regions to be systematically lost or gained for each of the two chemotherapeutics.Sequential epirubicin and docetaxel monotherapy
  caused profound redistribution of smaller subclones in primary breast cancer, while early truncal mutations and major subclones generally
  persisted through treatment.
